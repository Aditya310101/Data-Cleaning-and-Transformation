# Data Cleaning Project: Excel Data Cleaning

Welcome to the README section of the Excel Data Cleaning project. This project showcases my skills as a Data Analyst in efficiently cleaning and preparing a dataset for further analysis. The project involved several key tasks aimed at enhancing data quality and consistency.

## Project Tasks:

1. Converting the Data Set into a Table:
I began by converting the raw data into an Excel table. This step provides structured formatting and easy referencing for subsequent cleaning processes.

3. Removal of Duplicates:
Identifying and removing duplicate records was essential to ensure data accuracy. By eliminating duplicates, the dataset's integrity was improved, leading to more reliable insights.

5. Filling Up Empty Data Cells:
Empty cells were systematically identified and filled using appropriate techniques. This process ensured the completeness of the dataset, preventing gaps in the analysis due to missing data. Like filling out the "Loan Date End" Column with "Not on Loan" for Empty Cells as it signifies the respective Player not being on Loan.

7. Replacing Junk Characters throughout the Dataset:
To maintain data consistency, I meticulously replaced any non-standard or junk characters present in the dataset. This step helps in standardizing the data for further processing. Some of the Junk Characters found ("â†“", "â‚¬", "Ã“", etc)

9. Splitting Column "Contract" into Two Columns using Text to Columns:
I used the Text to Columns feature in Excel to split the "Contract" format into two separate columns. This transformation allowed for better organization and analysis of temporal data.

11. Using Appropriate Formulas to Apply Where Needed:
Applying suitable formulas, I ensured consistency across relevant data fields. This step improved data presentation and made it easier to navigate and interpret.

# Conclusion:
This project showcases my expertise in data cleaning using Excel, a fundamental aspect of data engineering. The completed tasks collectively contribute to a more organized, accurate, and reliable dataset, laying the foundation for more insightful analysis.
